# BR-daily-work-schedule

## Description
The link to this project:https://bruano95.github.io/BR-daily-work-schedule/

This project allows users to set a scheduler for the current work day. The scheduler shows the current date at the top of the page and exhibits the hours within a work day. Here, users are able to enter in "To-Do" items and save using the save button located directly to the right of each time block. This information is then saved within the local storage. The time blocks change colors accordingly to the current time of the day. Past times turn grey, Present time is represented by the color red, and future times are represented by green.
